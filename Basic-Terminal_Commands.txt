In this file we will discuss the main terminal commands that you should know before start working with "git" or any software depending on termainals and command lines
if your familiar with this concept you can just skip this file and start with git.

1) the command "pwd":
usually we use this command to know the path of our directory that we are working in.

2) the command "cd": 
this command is used to pass to a specific folder. For example if we have a folder named "new" and we want to enter it using a command, then we can use "cd new".
If we want to go back to the latest folder or directory we use the command "cd ..".

3) the command "mkdir":
we use this command to create a new folder within our directory.

4) the command "touch":
we use this command to create a new file (txt, html, css....) in the current directory.

5) the command "ls":
we use the this command to see the files that are already created in our current directory.

6) the command "mv":
we use this command to change the name of a specific file. For example if we want to change the name of "index.html" file to "about.html" file, we use the command as follows:
"mv index.html about.html"

7) the command "rm":
we use this file to delete a file, for example if we want to delete our index.html file, we use the command as follows:
"rm index.html"

8) the command "rm -rf":
we use this command to delete folder, the same as we had done in the above command (7).

9) the command "clear":
we use this command to clear our command line window (power shell, cmd, windows termianl ....) from previous commands and lines.

10) the command "code":
this command is used to open a file in vscode IDE. For example:
"code index.html"
then after clicking on enter the file index.html will be opened in vscode.

Conclusion:
These are the main commands that we should know to be able to work with git and to deal with terminals.

**Let us continue and start with "git"**
